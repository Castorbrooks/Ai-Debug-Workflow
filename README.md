# AI-Assisted Debug & Repair Workflow

This repository explains the structured workflow
used to diagnose, isolate, and fix broken automation systems
using AI-assisted analysis.

Focus: **accuracy, safety, and speed** — not hype.

---

## What this workflow is

• A repeatable debugging system
• Designed for broken crypto bots and automations
• Focused on root-cause analysis
• Safe for client assets

This is **not** auto-coding or blind AI usage.

---

## Core workflow steps

1. Problem isolation  
2. Log and behavior analysis  
3. Failure pattern matching  
4. AI-assisted root-cause reasoning  
5. Minimal logic correction  
6. Validation in safe environment

---

## Why AI is used (and how)

AI is used to:
• Analyze logs and error patterns  
• Detect logic edge-cases  
• Suggest safe fixes  
• Reduce diagnosis time

AI is **never** given keys or live access.

## Safety principles

• No private keys required  
• No exchange logins  
• No blind code execution  
• Sandbox / dry-run validation only  
• Human verification at every step

---

## Typical outcomes

• Faster diagnosis  
• Cleaner fixes  
• Reduced repeat failures  
• Stable long-term operation

---

## Who this workflow is for

• Traders with broken bots  
• Automation teams under pressure  
• Developers inheriting legacy code  
• Anyone needing fast, safe repairs

---

A broken system does not need more code —
it needs **clear diagnosis**.
